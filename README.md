# blackjack1
my first python game, leave suggestions pls i need help

i know this is horribly unoptomized, i didnt use any funcitons and the game should be half the legnth that is is. i also know that it does not have all the features that real blackjack has, but i will change that and make a blackjackv2 in the future. feel free to leave suggestions and/or criticisms, because i need them.
